                        <strong>Banter Group</strong> is committed to providing quality services to you and this
                        policy outlines our ongoing obligations to you in respect of how we manage your Personal
                        Information.
                    </p>
                    <p> We have adopted the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988
                        (Cth) (the Privacy Act). The NPPs govern the way in which we collect, use, disclose, store,
                        secure and dispose of your Personal Information. </p>
                    <p> A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office
                        of the Federal Privacy Commissioner at <a href="https://www.privacy.gov.au/">

                    <h5>What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?</h5>
                    <p> Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual. Examples of
                        Personal Information we collect include: names, addresses, email addresses and phone
                        numbers. </p>
                    <p> This Personal Information is obtained in many ways including questionnaires, surveys, by
                        telephone, email, via our website or from other publicly available sources and from third
                        parties. We don’t guarantee website links or policy of authorised third parties. </p>
                    <p> We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our services to
                        you, providing information to our clients and marketing. We may also use your Personal
                        Information for secondary purposes closely related to the primary purpose, in circumstances
                        where you would reasonably expect such use or disclosure. You may unsubscribe from our
                        mailing/marketing lists at any time by contacting us in writing. </p>
                    <p> When we collect Personal Information we will, where appropriate and where possible, explain
                        to you why we are collecting the information and how we plan to use it. </p>
                    <h5>Sensitive Information</h5>
                    <p> Sensitive information is defined in the Privacy Act to include information or opinion about
                        such things as an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a
                        political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union or
                        other professional body, criminal record or health information. Sensitive information will
                        not be used by us. </p>
                    <h5>Third Parties</h5>
                    <p> Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal Information only
                        from you. However, in some circumstances we may be provided with information by third
                        parties. In such a case we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of
                        the information provided to us by the third party. </p>
                    <h5>Disclosure of Personal Information</h5>
                    <p> Your Personal Information may be disclosed in a number of circumstances including the
                        following: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Third parties where you consent to the use or disclosure; and</li>
                        <li>Where required or authorised by law.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Security of Personal Information</h5>
                    <p> Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse and
                        loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. </p>
                    <p> When your Personal Information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was
                        obtained, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your Personal
                        Information. However, most of the Personal Information is or will be stored in client files
                        which will be kept by us for a minimum of 7 years. </p>
                    <h5>Access to your Personal Information</h5>
                    <p> You may access the Personal Information we hold about you and to update and/or correct it,
                        subject to certain exceptions. If you wish to access your Personal Information, please
                        contact us in writing. </p>
                    <p> Banter Group will not charge any fee for your access request, but may charge an
                        administrative fee for providing a copy of your Personal Information. </p>
                    <p> In order to protect your Personal Information we may require identification from you before
                        releasing the requested information. </p>
                    <h5>Maintaining the Quality of your Personal Information</h5>
                    <p> It is an important to us that your Personal Information is up to date. We will take
                        reasonable steps to make sure that your Personal Information is accurate, complete and
                        up-to-date. If you find that the information we have is not up to date or is inaccurate,
                        please advise us as soon as practicable so we can update our records and ensure we can
                        continue to provide quality services to you. </p>
